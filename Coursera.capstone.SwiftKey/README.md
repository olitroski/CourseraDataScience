If you find this, please read.

This is how it work... I expend a lot, a lot... really a lot of time and effor in order to get this shit working... properly? ... mmm I dont know. I hate this courses a little and I did this to the end only because I paid. In terms of educational skills this guys do nothing for help us. Any way, is finished... and I am happy.

Despites my bad experience, because I will never take a course in JHB again, at least with this guys. I want to give you something dear student, I dont want you to suffer like I did... I'll give you the key for this final course.

Here you will find 3 things... the Slide deck, its simple, but if you dont know how to program it.... use it as reference.

That main script of for cleaning and create ngrams. It will made your text file (corpse if you want) smooth and clean, like a baby's ass after a bath. Also you can compute the freaking ngrams. Finally I'll give you the app made in Shiny.

Why I do this? Because all the gentle people who left his work published. Thank to you I finished this "especialization", I think this is the hardest part of the course so now I left it for all of you.

A disclaimer, sorry about my english. I speak spanish by default.
Oh and of course I left to you the algorithm in a script.

Live long and prosper.... :P
BTW: if you want to run the app, you need to setwd() in the folder where you have the ui, server, and folder with the data.
